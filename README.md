# Pintalk - Just talk what you see about!
Pintalk is basically a chatting software with synchronized map. 
If you want to show your place to your friends, where you live, where you hang around. how could you explain to your friends? I'm guessing you might use chatting software and you should open google map respectively. Is this map synchronized between users? I don't think so. Please use [Pintalk(https://pintalk.co.kr)](https://pintalk.co.kr) right now! It is on Beta service now.

I'm in the middle of making Pintalk open-source.
I'm going to update every config and explanation in really soon.
I will be a good guide for chatting programe with webrtc and google map as well!

## How Pintalk works  
Pintalk is built by Node.js, Socket.io, Laravel and Javascript basically. 


## Build by open-source
There are hundreads of thousands of good opensources out there nowadays. Pintalk also uses good opensource which is about Webrtc(real-time chatting). This is the key technical resource. We are using easyrtc(https://easyrtc.com/) in the first place. 

I'm still organizing sources which I built, I've been focused on making functions first. Please consider it!
